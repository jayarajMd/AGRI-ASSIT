# AGRI-ASSIT
This is an ESP32-based Smart Soil Monitoring System that reads key agricultural data—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) via Modbus (RS485), pH via serial, and Soil Moisture via analog input—and wirelessly uploads these metrics to a Google Firebase Realtime Database for remote, real-time tracking and analysis.
